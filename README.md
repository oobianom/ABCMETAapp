# ABCMETAapp: A Simulation-Based Estimation Approach to Meta-Analysis

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/ABCMETAapp](https://shinyappstore.com/a/ABCMETAapp)__

ABCMETAapp is a versatile application designed for the implementation of approximate Bayesian computation on diverse datasets. It offers flexibility by allowing users to select an outcome distribution other than the normal distribution, particularly useful when dealing with skewed or heavy-tailed outcome variable distributions. This R Shiny application provides a user-friendly interface for executing ABCMETA, which employs five different distributions for estimating the outcome variable. ABCMETA utilizes a set of common summary statistics, including minimum value, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum value, and sample size. The app accommodates three potential situations based on the available summary statistics in a given study, providing a tailored approach for each scenario. Users can input data for situations where four reported quantities are available, where estimates of the first and third quartiles are present. Published: Res Synth Methods. 2021 Nov;12(6):842-848.
